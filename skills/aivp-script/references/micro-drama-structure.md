# Micro-Drama Script Structure

Rules specific to short-form vertical drama (1-3 min episodes, 9:16 or horizontal YouTube adaptations).

## The 3-7-21 Rule

- **3 seconds** — grab attention (visual/audio shock)
- **7 seconds** — establish the conflict
- **21 seconds** — complete the first emotional cycle (hook → spike → breath)

## Hook Window (0-15 seconds)

Chinese showrunners call the opening "爆点" (detonation). Start mid-crisis:
- The slap lands
- The gun jams
- The bride bolts
- The document is slammed on the table

Many studios drop the most cinematic beat of the entire season into the first 15 seconds as a built-in trailer.

**Never open with:** establishing shots, character introductions, "meanwhile" transitions, or exposition dialogue.

## Emotional Pacing

A 90-second episode needs at least **2 emotional spikes** (reveal, reversal, burst of joy/dread).

For longer formats (8-12 min YouTube episodes), target a spike every **60-90 seconds**:

```
[0:00]  🔴 HOOK — open mid-crisis
[0:15]  🟡 BUILD — establish stakes
[1:00]  🟢 PEAK 1 — first reversal
[1:30]  🟡 BUILD — deepen
[2:30]  🟢 PEAK 2 — second reversal
[3:30]  🟡 BUILD — raise stakes
[4:30]  🟢 PEAK 3 — revelation
[5:00]  🟡 BUILD — consequences
[6:00]  🟢 PEAK 4 — confrontation
[7:00]  🟡 BUILD — false resolution
[8:00]  🔴 CLIMAX — biggest reversal
[8:30]  🔵 RELEASE + CLIFFHANGER
```

## Scene Constraints

- **Maximum 5 recurring locations** per episode (living room, office, hospital, alley, car)
- Tight focus = medium and close-up shots (saves budget AND viewer bandwidth)
- No "connective tissue" — cut directly between emotional beats

## Character Design for Speed

- **Binary conflict in 4 words:** rich bully vs underdog, cheating fiancé vs vengeful bride
- **Visual "tell"** for instant recognition: a ring, a scar, a twitch, distinctive clothing
- Characters must be recognizable from visual silhouette alone (important for AI consistency)

## Cliffhanger Types

| Type | Example | Strength |
|------|---------|----------|
| Revelation | "He's not who you think he is" | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Danger | Character in physical peril | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Betrayal | Trusted person seen with enemy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Choice | Impossible decision, time running out | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Arrival | Unexpected person appears | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Discovery | Character finds hidden object/message | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Emotion Intensity Markers (from Huobao architecture)

Use alongside beat markers for fine-grained emotional pacing:

| Marker | Intensity | Example |
|:------:|-----------|---------|
| ↑↑↑ | Extreme | Betrayal reveal, violent confrontation |
| ↑↑ | Strong | Major reversal, confession |
| ↑ | Moderate | Suspicion confirmed, important discovery |
| → | Neutral | Transition, establishing context |
| ↓ | Low/release | Aftermath, brief calm before next storm |

In the pacing map, combine with beat markers:

```
[0:00]  🔴 HOOK ↑↑↑ — open mid-crisis
[0:15]  🟡 BUILD →  — establish stakes
[1:00]  🟢 PEAK ↑↑  — first reversal
[2:30]  🟢 PEAK ↑↑↑ — betrayal revealed
[3:30]  🔵 RELEASE ↓ — brief aftermath
```

## Dialogue Compression

Every line must do at least one of:
1. Advance plot
2. Reveal character
3. Create tension

Ideally, every line does 2 of 3. Lines that do none get cut.

**Bad:** "Hi, how was your day?"
**Good:** "You changed the locks." (advances plot + reveals relationship state + creates tension)
