# Hook Generation Guide

For each selected topic, generate 3-5 hook variants. Style: **clear and concise**.

## Hook Patterns

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Direct | State the value plainly | "3 AI tools that actually save time" |
| Data | Lead with a number | "87% of startups fail at this one thing" |
| Contrast | Set up a reversal | "Everyone uses ChatGPT wrong. Here's why." |
| Story | Tease a narrative | "I automated my entire workflow. Here's what happened." |
| Question | Ask what they're thinking | "Is your morning routine actually making you less productive?" |

## Rules

- No clickbait that doesn't deliver
- No emoji spam
- Every hook must be defensible by the video content
- Under 15 words preferred
