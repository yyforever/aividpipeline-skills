# Layer 0: AI Capability Baseline Research

**This is the foundation. All topic selection depends on knowing what AI can and cannot produce TODAY.**

Before researching trends or topics, research the current state of AI video generation.

## Search Queries (use current month/year)

- `AI video generation capabilities {current_month} {current_year}`
- `best AI video model comparison {current_year}`
- `{latest_model} review capabilities limitations {current_month} {current_year}`
- `AI video character consistency {current_year}` (verify — do NOT assume this is still a problem)
- `AI video generation audio dialogue {current_year}`
- `AI video length duration limit {current_year}`

## Capability Matrix Template

| Capability | Status | Best Model(s) | Notes | Source Date |
|------------|--------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Max resolution | ? | ? | | |
| Max duration per clip | ? | ? | | |
| Character consistency | ? | ? | | |
| Lip sync / dialogue | ? | ? | | |
| Camera motion control | ? | ? | | |
| Multi-scene coherence | ? | ? | | |
| Audio generation | ? | ? | | |
| Emotional expression | ? | ? | | |
| Action / movement | ? | ? | | |
| Text rendering in video | ? | ? | | |
| Style consistency | ? | ? | | |

## Derive Zones

- **Green zone** — content types that current AI does WELL → lean into these for topic selection
- **Yellow zone** — possible with effort/workarounds
- **Red zone** — still not feasible → avoid these content types

**This matrix directly constrains topic scoring** — a topic in the Red zone gets AI Feasibility = 1 regardless of demand.

## Reuse Rule

Save output to `ideation/notes/ai-capabilities.md`. If existing file is < 30 days old, reuse it. If > 30 days, refresh.
