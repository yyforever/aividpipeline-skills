# Information Freshness Rules

Different types of information have different shelf lives. Always check and label.

| Category | Shelf Life | Freshness Requirement | Example |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| **AI model capabilities** | 1-3 months | Must use data from **last 30 days** | "Kling 3.0 supports X" |
| **Platform policies** | 3-6 months | Must use data from **last 3 months** | "YouTube YPP requires..." |
| **Market trends / niches** | 6-12 months | Last 6 months acceptable | "Short drama is $8B market" |
| **Human psychology / storytelling** | Years | Evergreen, no freshness concern | "Suspense hooks retain attention" |

## Rules

- When searching for AI model capabilities, **always add current year+month** to queries
- When a finding could be outdated, cross-check with a second source dated within 30 days
- In the brief, tag each claim with its source date: `(source, Feb 2026)` or `(source, 2025 — verify freshness)`
- **Never assume AI limitations from >3 months ago still apply** — the field moves too fast
