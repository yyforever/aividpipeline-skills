# Topic Selection & Scoring Framework

Every candidate topic must answer these questions:

| # | Question | Options |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Search or Viral?** | Searchable / Shareable / Both |
| 2 | **Who watches?** | Specific audience segment |
| 3 | **What's the hook?** | One sentence that stops the scroll |
| 4 | **Data backing?** | Trend data, search volume, community demand |
| 5 | **AI feasibility?** | Green / Yellow / Red (from Layer 0 matrix) |
| 6 | **Shelf life?** | Evergreen / Trending (weeks) / Time-sensitive (days) |

## Scoring Weights

| Dimension | Weight | 1 (Low) | 5 (High) |
|-----------|:------:|---------|----------|
| Demand signal | 25% | No data | Strong trend + community demand |
| Competition gap | 20% | Saturated | Few good videos exist |
| Audience fit | 20% | Tangential | Core audience |
| AI feasibility | 20% | Red zone | Green zone, plays to AI strengths |
| Monetization safety | 15% | High demonetization risk | Clearly policy-compliant |

> **Note:** "AI feasibility" is scored based on the Layer 0 capability matrix, not assumptions.
> A topic in the Red zone gets AI Feasibility = 1 regardless of demand.
